# DSA-Project-documentation
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis of Amazon product listings and customer review data using Microsoft Excel.

## Project objecive
To perform structured data cleaning, transformation, and analysis of Amazon product review data using Excel functions, PivotTables, and visualizations, aiming to explore relationships between discounts, ratings, and revenue drivers.

## Data set used
-<a href="https://github.com/Mary-Onoba/DSA-Project-documentation/blob/main/Amazon%20case%20study-DSA%20Project.xlsx">Amazon product review data</a>

## Analysis Tasks 
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, 
₹200–₹500, >₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

## Key Insights from the Amazon Product Review Analysis
### Discount Strategies
- Electronics and Accessories categories offered the highest average discounts, with many products falling in the 61–80% discount bucket.
- A noticeable concentration of top-rated products appears in the 41–70% discount range, suggesting an optimal discount window for maintaining high product appeal.
### Customer Engagement
- Products with the highest number of reviews tend to be basic, affordable tech accessories.
- Engagement is heavily skewed toward a small subset of products, indicating a "long tail" in customer interaction.
### Revenue Potential
- The total potential revenue (based on actual_price × rating_count) is highest in the Electronics category, driven by volume and visibility.
- This metric helps prioritize which product types deserve additional marketing investment.
### Price Buckets
- The majority of products fall within the ₹200–₹500 range, aligning with strong review volume and better average ratings.
- Premium-priced items (>₹500) are fewer but show more polarized ratings.
### Discount vs Rating Relationship
- A line chart of average ratings across discount buckets reveals a bell-shaped curve, where moderate discounts (30–70%) align with higher ratings.
- Products with extreme discounts (90%+) tend to have lower ratings, suggesting a potential trade-off between price slashing and quality perception.
### Top Performers
- The top 5 products, ranked by a combined score of rating and review count, are standout candidates for featured promotions or bundling strategies.
## Conclusion

This analysis of Amazon product review data reveals powerful insights into how pricing strategies, product quality, and customer engagement intersect in the e-commerce space. Moderate discounting particularly in the 30–70% range emerges as a sweet spot where perceived value and product satisfaction align, driving higher ratings and review volumes.

High engagement is concentrated among a few high-performing products, underscoring the importance of strategic positioning and visibility. The Electronics category not only dominates in volume but also shows strong potential for revenue generation, making it a prime focus for sellers and marketers.

Importantly, the relationship between discounts and ratings demonstrates that deeper discounts don't always lead to better perception. Maintaining product quality while offering competitive pricing is key to sustaining customer trust.

Overall, this project highlights the value of structured data analysis in guiding product development, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing customer experience in the online retail environment
